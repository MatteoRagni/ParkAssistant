In this work will be presented some alghoritms that identify free spots in parking lot. 
The alghoritms are parametric, do not need an image af the complete parking lot free, 
and some insight to improve them are presented in the different chapter. In the first 
part we will get some insight of the system that divide the single parking spot from 
the whole image, and than we will analize the two different alghoritms used to
get the \emph{status} of a spot.

Must be taken into account the didactical natur of this project. Optimization is
put aside, while the largest different solutions are used to obtain the final
result. This is one of the main reason that brought us to write a code that uses
two different solutions for initialization and for real time processing.
